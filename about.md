Valente directs the Center for Applied Network Analysis (CANA) which hosts a twice monthly, two-hour, lab meeting in which students, post-docs, and faculty present work in progress.  Currently there are 30 active members of CANA from six different schools across the University of Southern California (USC).

CANA meetings cover a diverse set of topics all pertaining to conducting research using the social network approach.  A primary emphasis is to present work in progress (WIP) so members can present drafts of the research and work out interpretation of findings.  WIP topics range from how to construct a survey, to methods to increase response rates, and how to manage oneâ€™s data.

CANA also conducts workshops on technology and techniques for conducting analysis.  Recent workshops include basic R, STATNET for network analysis, ERGM and SIENA.
